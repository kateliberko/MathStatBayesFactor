In this bookdown we will explore Bayes Factor in all of its glory and have fun at the same time! Enjoy :) "],["motivation.html", " Chapter 1 Motivation", " Chapter 1 Motivation A Bayes factor ratio is used to evaluate data and compare a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. In hypothesis testing, one hypothesis is accepted and the other rejected when the data is weak and can be considered non significant. However, while using Bayes factors, data is never discarded, but instead a ratio between the two hypotheses is given to allow for a better understanding of the relationship between the two and to allow for interpretation using the ratio itself.
