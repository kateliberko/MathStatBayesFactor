<h1><span class="header-section-number"> Chapter 5</span> Real World Applications</h1>
<p>Bayes Factors are not just a fun way to make a math textbook longer, they actually have real world applications. Statisticians use Bayes Factors all the time to interpret and compare data models in the real world. We have found some interesting real world applications of Bayes Factors that we explore in this chapter.</p>
<div id="hot-hands" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Hot Hands</h2>
<p>Sports fans often attribute a player’s good or bad performance in a match to them having a “good day” or an “off day”. “Hot hands” is a term suggesting that the probability of a player making a shot is higher based on their previous performance in that game or the preceding games. It has been suggested that a given player’s shots may actually follow a binomial distribution, and that these “good days” and “off days” may be just random sequences of this larger sample. Misinterpreting these sequences can lead to the assumption that a player has hot hands when in reality this is just a sequence of good shots that happen to be near each other in a larger binomial distribution. In order to test this, data was collected on basketball player Larry Bird’s game by game performance for an entire season consisting of 44 games. The null hypothesis was that Larry Bird’s shooting percentages resulted from 44 binomial distributions (one distribution each game) with equal probabilities of success for each shot. That is, 44 different groups of multiple independent flips of a “Larry Bird coin.” It was found that the null hypothesis fit the data from the season well, however this may have also been due to the sample size being small. In order to check this, an alternative to the binomial could be defined as: the parameters for the binomial distribution vary across each game. The posterior odds of the binomial could then be calculated. This process can be used to evaluate other players and compare their Bayes Factors.<span class="math inline">\(\\\)</span>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Ozone Exceedances</h2>
<p>Rising air-pollution is a topic that is very prevalent in today’s world. In the US there are thresholds of ozone levels that must not be exceeded more than 3 times in a given 3-year period. Many cities including Houston, Texas are exceeding this threshold far more than their fair-share. Ozone exceedances can be measured and compared over time to see if Houston and other cities’ pollution levels are decreasing. These exceedances can be modeled using a Poisson process where the rate is varying over time. Specifically Adrian E Raftery from the American Statistical Association uses three models for rates that represent no change, a gradual decrease, and an abrupt decrease (Kass). They compare these models to see which rate model fits the data best over time. Bayes is not only used for comparison in this case, but also for continuing to update the models based on which models fit the data best.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Formation of Mutations in E.Coli DNA</h2>
<p>In a molecular biology experiment, researchers hypothesized that mutations leading to “acetate utilization deficiency” in the uvrE strain of E. coli bacteria, were caused by an abnormal error-prone DNA repair mechanism and not by DNA replication. If this hypothesis was correct, then the mutation would not be linked to mutations at neighboring loci. But if DNA replication were responsible and not the error-prone DNA repair mechanism, then the mutation would be linked to the rare trait of “rifampin resistance.” To test the hypothesis, researchers made two rows of cells; one containing “selected” cells for rifampin resistance and the other made up of “unselected” cells. The absence of a linkage (predicted by the hypothesis) would suggest that the proportions <span class="math inline">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_2\)</span> of bacteria showing acetate utilization deficiency in both cell lines would be equal. The researchers found that the two proportions were indeed approximately equal and supported their hypothesis of error-prone DNA causing the mutation. However, using this hypothesis test, the researchers were only able to accept the null, but they were not able to assess the evidence in favor of the null. Moreover, the researchers had data on 12 other E. coli strains that all showed varying ranges of difference between <span class="math inline">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_2\)</span>. Therefore, each strain appeared to have its own level of how it was affected by the error-prone DNA repair mechanism, some being more strongly impacted than others. The fact that they wished to know the strength of the evidence in favor of their hypothesis, along with the fact that they had more data to construct an alternative hypothesis, or prior information, indicate that a Bayesian approach would be most useful. A Bayes Factor would give them a ratio between the null and the alternative hypotheses therefore indicating the degree to which the data favors the null.<span class="math inline">\(\\\)</span>
